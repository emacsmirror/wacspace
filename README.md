wacspace.el
===========

The WACky WorkSPACE manager for emACS.

## Installation

Wacspace will hopefully soon be available on
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and
[Melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/), so you can install easily with
`M-x package-install`. Until then, you can put `wacspace.el` on your
load path and `(require 'wacspace)`. Wacspace requires Emacs version
24.3 or greater and [dash.el](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el)
(available on Marmalade and Melpa).

## Usage

Using wacspace is very easy: just bind `wacspace` and `wacspace-save`
to convenient key sequences like so:

```elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c w") 'wacspace)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") 'wacspace-save)
```

(You can use any keybindings you like.) Then, use `wacspace` when
you're visiting a file of a particular type, with or without a prefix
key. Your workspace (windows, buffers, and frame alignment) will be
automatically set up. To use an alternate workspace for a given file
type, use numeric prefix keys—wacspace supports up to 10
configurations for a given file type.

### Saving and restoring

The first time you use `wacspace` on a buffer, your workspace will be
set up based on your configuration (see Configuration). Once your
workspace is set up, wacspace will automatically save your window
configuration. If you use `wacspace` on any of the buffers that were
set up, it will jump to the window setup without re-running your
configuration.

You can also save your configuration at any time using
(unsurprisingly) `wacspace-save`. `wacspace-save` can also use a
numeric prefix, in which case using `wacspace` with that numeric
prefix will access that workspace. The behavior is intuitive but a
little bit subtle—if you want concrete examples of how it works, check
out [features/wacs-save.feature](features/wacs-save.feature).

The frame size is not saved/restored like the rest of the
configuration. Instead, if you specify a frame alignment for a prefix
key in your configuration, that frame alignment will always be
restored when you use wacspace with that prefix key on windows set up
with that configuration. This behavior is subject to change in future
versions of wacspace. For instance, with the example configuration
below, if you set up a workspace with prefix key `1`, any time you run
`C-1 wacspace` in any of the windows set up by that workspace, the
frame will be full.

## Configuration

Configuring wacspace is a little harder, but you usually only need to
use one macro: `defwacspace`. Here's an example to get you started:

```elisp
(defwacspace (ruby-mode rinari-minor-mode)
  (:before rinari-console)
  (:default
   (:winconf 3winv)
   (:aux1 (:buffer "*rails console*"))
   (:aux2 (:cmd eshell)))
  (:1
   (:frame full))
  (:2
   (:winconf 2winh)
   (:frame left))
  (:3
   (:main (:buffer "*rails console*"))
   (:aux1 (:buffer :main))
   (:winconf 2winh)
   (:frame right)
```

The basic form is `(defwacspace (major-mode &optional aux-cond) &body
config)`. The `aux-cond` can either be a variable (such as
`rinari-minor-mode`, or any other minor mode variable for that matter)
or an inline lambda, such as `(lambda () (string-match "spec\\.rb$"
(buffer-name)))` (note that there is no need for quoting). If you
don't provide an auxiliary condition, the wacspace will be the default
for the major mode and will be used when none of the auxiliary
conditions for other wacspaces are met.

The configuration currently supports the following options:

- `:before` A function to run before setting up the workspace
- `:default` The default configuration
- `:[1-9]` The configuration to use with the corresponding prefix
  keys. Note that these inherit from the default configuration.
- `:after` A function to run after setting up the workspace

Within the configurations, the following options are available:

- `:winconf` The window configuration to use (see later)
- `:frame` The frame alignment to use (see later)
- `:main` The top-left window
- `:aux[1-5]` Auxiliary window number [1-5] (in the order of
  `other-window`)

There are 2 options to set up a window:

- `:buffer` Switch to buffer name (or `:main`, which signifies the
  buffer from which `wacspace` was invoked)
- `:cmd` a command to invoke

### Window Configurations

A winconf is basically just a function to set up your windows. You can
define your own using `defwinconf`:

```elisp
(defwinconf my-cool-winconf
  (split-window-right)
  (split-window-right)
  (split-window-below)
  (split-window-below)
  (other-window 3)
  (split-window-left))
```

(This is a terrible example of a usable window configuration). You can
assume that your function will start with just one window and you
don't have to worry about having the primary window active in the end.
Wacspace comes with some nice winconfs built in:

#### 3winv

    +----------+-----------+

### Frame Configuration

Due to the wide variety of GUI/terminal experiences for Emacs and
screen resolutions, I haven't attempted to include frame-setting
functions with wacspace. Instead, you can use your own functions and
set them using `wacs-set-frame-fn`:

```elisp
(wacs-set-frame-function full my-fill-screen-fn)
```

In the future, I might add helper functions to set up your own frame
functions.

### TODO/Contributing

Wacspace is in early alpha phase, and I plan to add more features and
fix behavior. Any comments/suggestions/pull requests are welcome.
Eventually, I would also like to include a variety of default
configurations for various modes.
