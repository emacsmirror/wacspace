wacspace.el
===========

A context-sensitive WorkSPACE manager for emACS. When you invoke wacspace,
your window configuration will be automatically set up based on the major mode
of the file you're visiting and other conditions.

## Installation

wacspace.el will hopefully soon be available on
[marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and
[Melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/), so you can install easily with `M-x
package-install`.  Until then, you can put wacspace.el on your load path and
`(require 'wacspace)`.  wacspace.el requires Emacs version 24.3 or greater.

## Usage and configuration
